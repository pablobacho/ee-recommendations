# Electronic Engineering Recommendations

This is a collection of recommendations I adhere to when working on electronic designs and developing firmware.

They are the result of years of experience working with companies big and small. I hope they serve as inspiration to fellow engineers looking to standardize their processes. Feel free to take whatever you find useful and adapt it to your use-case.
